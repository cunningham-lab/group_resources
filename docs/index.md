# Group Resources 
One exciting opportunity that came out of our inaugural group meeting discussion was a way to share resources (papers, code, ideas) with other group members.  
This page can be a shared location where we can all compile resources that we think are worth sharing. I will also include tutorials on how to add new sections and resources. 

## Papers 

## Code 

## Soft Skills 


This semester, we had a discussion on professional coding practices in python.  Iâ€™ve compiled these ideas into a template repo, which can get you off the ground with gitpage documentation, packaging, unit testing, and continuous integration.  On this gitpage, I'll explain the functionality of the template, and how to adapt it for your project.  The end of each section contains tips and rules of thumb for each topic.
