# Group Resources 
One exciting opportunity that came out of our inaugural Fall 2021 group meeting discussion was a way to share resources with other group members.  
This page can be a location where we can all compile resources that we think are worth sharing. On each page I will also include examples on how to add new sections and resources. 

This page owes a great deal to Sean Bittner's post on best practices for organizing a git template, found [here](https://github.com/cunningham-lab/git_template), as well as the blog run by the Columbia Advanced Machine Learning Seminar ([see here](https://github.com/casmls)). 

## Papers 

You can find a list of papers organized by topic [here](../group_resources/papers). Feel free to add more, and start your own subsections if you don't see one that suits the paper you want to add! 

## Code 

> *"Code is our craft"*
>     - Dan Biderman

As researchers in computational science, we spend a significant amount of our time coding. There are many tools and teaching resources available online that can make this part of our research more efficient and enjoyable. See [this page](../group_resources/code) for a list of software and teaching resources that people in our group like to use. 

## Soft Skills 

Beyond new papers and code, we would like to improve our skills in those aspects of research that are harder to define- how to work together effectively, dealing with the stress of publishing, building good work habits, etc. [Here](../group_resources/soft_skills) you can find links to resources that we found helpful for these topics.
