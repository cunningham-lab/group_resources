Here are papers that are of interest to our group. If adding new papers, please do so in the following format:  

```
- Author List, "Title", Journal (Year). [link](url)
  - Comments 
```

For example:  

```
- Benton, Gregory W., et al. "Loss Surface Simplexes for Mode Connecting Volumes and Fast Ensembling." arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.13042 (2021). [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13042)
  - A cool paper that reduces the computational cost of ensembling by exploiting unexpected structure in the loss landscape. 
```

In this case I just copied the MLA formatted Google Scholar `Cite` text, and added a link afterwards.
