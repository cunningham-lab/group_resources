        - Understand other learning/working styles
        - Gain new knowledge from the literature 
        - Gain new coding skills


## Summary 

- Strong mandate to have group meetings. 
    - Main objectives: 
        - build a strong and supportive community  
        - learning how to be more effective researchers. 
        - Suggestion: If we agree on these goals, let's be proactive in making sure that they happen. If some part of the format is not working, we should discuss.  
- Meeting format: 
    - Healthy support for weekly meetings.  
    - Lots of interest in skills (coding, soft skills like management) that are less common for our research settings. It's worth devoting some time to figuring out the best format for this kind of meeting.   
        - Suggestion: Approach this through simulations in addition to traditional presentations. Introduce a problem, give everyone time to think on their own, and then compare answers.  
    - Research topics are mostly statistical machine learning, with some neuroscience topics as well.  
    - Suggestion: Let's make a schedule of topics (research and skills) that covers the semester, and people can opt in to whatever topic they want (as individuals, as pairs). We can also plan field trips here!
